# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "FINAL FIX COMPLETED: Resolved the root cause where profile field was stored as JSON string with invalid NaN values. Updated /api/passports endpoint (lines 266-276) to properly parse profile JSON string by: 1) Replacing invalid NaN values with null to make valid JSON, 2) Parsing the cleaned JSON string into object, 3) Handling parse errors gracefully with empty object fallback. Student names from profile.name field now correctly extracted and displayed. Verified working: API returns proper student name 'Rakshitha.M', frontend displays correctly, no more 'Unknown Student' fallback text. Screenshot verification shows student name displaying correctly on Passports page."

Updated 3 critical files: 1) lib/supabase-server.js getSession() function now uses getUser() with proper JWT validation and expiration handling. 2) middleware.js authentication check updated to use getUser() with graceful JWT expiration logging. 3) app/api/auth/session/route.js session API endpoint updated to use getUser() with detailed error responses for JWT issues. Added proper error handling for JWT expiration scenarios with informative logging. This resolves the security warnings about using getSession() and improves JWT token validation throughout the application."

SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS VERIFIED: No more 'Using the user object as returned from supabase.auth.getSession() could be insecure' warnings. JWT validation through getUser() method working correctly.

    message: "MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETED: Converted single-page application to proper Next.js routing structure with route groups. Implemented secure session management with JWT and httpOnly cookies. Created middleware for route protection. All MongoDB references removed (already using Supabase only). New routing structure: / redirects to /dashboard, /login for authentication, /dashboard, /users, /passports, /reports, /audit-logs, /integrations, /settings as separate routes. All pages maintain exact same design and functionality. Authentication now uses secure server-side sessions instead of localStorage. Middleware protects all dashboard routes and redirects unauthenticated users to /login."

    message: "SUPABASE AUTH INTEGRATION COMPLETED: Replaced custom authentication with native Supabase Auth for enterprise-grade security. Implemented proper server-side and client-side Supabase clients using @supabase/ssr. Updated all auth endpoints (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/session) to use Supabase Auth signInWithPassword, signOut, and getSession methods. Created setup script (scripts/setup-auth-users.js) to create test users in Supabase Auth with proper metadata sync to users table. Middleware now validates Supabase sessions with automatic token refresh. Test credentials: superadmin@rareminds.in / password123, admin@rareminds.in / password123, manager@rareminds.in / password123. All authentication now uses httpOnly cookies with automatic session management.

    message: "LOGOUT & TAB SWITCHING OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED: Fixed two critical UX issues reported by user. 1) Logout Implementation: Updated frontend to use window.location.href for hard redirect instead of Next.js router, ensuring complete state cleanup. Enhanced server-side logout API to explicitly clear all Supabase auth cookies with proper maxAge=0 settings. Logout now works reliably in all scenarios with forced page reload. 2) Tab Switching Performance: Converted Reports page from fetching all analytics data upfront to lazy loading per tab. Implemented individual loading states for each tab (university, recruiter, placement, heatmap, insights) with data caching. Added loading skeletons for instant visual feedback. Tab switching is now instant after initial data load - only fetches data when user clicks a tab for the first time. Created handleTabChange with smart prefetching. Result: Near-instant tab switching after initial load, more reliable logout with complete session cleanup."

All 4 required fields now present in response (email=superadmin@rareminds.in, role=super_admin, name=Super Admin, organizationId=RM). ❌ PASSPORTS ENDPOINT DATA ISSUE IDENTIFIED: /api/passports endpoint code is working correctly but passport references non-existent student (studentId=secure-auth-fix). Database has 712 students but passport references invalid student ID, causing students field to be missing from response. This is a data consistency issue, not a code issue.

The profile update functionality is working as designed - any frontend issues would be separate from the backend API which is functioning correctly."
