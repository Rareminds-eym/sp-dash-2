# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Original task was backend API testing with RBAC, Supabase backend, and PostgreSQL. Enhancement task completed: dashboard modernization with neumorphism design, enhanced charts, and theme switching. New task: Import recruiter data from Excel file (148 rows with 100% complete data) into database without duplicates and signup all recruiters in Supabase Auth. Latest task: Test performance optimization after applying database indexes (47 indexes across 8 tables for 15-30x performance improvement)."

ROOT CAUSE: Export endpoint data mapping logic expects p.students?.users?.email but actual data structure has p.students.email directly. GET /api/passports returns complete student data (name: 'Nithya Devi', email: 'nithya01devi2002@gmail.com') but export endpoint fails to map this data correctly.

Updated both /api/passports/export and /api/passports endpoints to: 1) Use student.universityId || student.organizationId for university lookup. 2) Use student.email directly as primary source. 3) Fixed university filter to check universityId.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: GET /api/passports correctly returns populated student data (email: 'rajadharshini3106@gmail.com', name: 'R.Rajadharshini', university: 'Annamalai University') but GET /api/passports/export returns empty fields for same data. The data mapping logic in export endpoint (lines 596-608) is not executing properly - passport.students objects are not being populated despite identical code to regular endpoint. Search functionality also broken: search for 'rajadharshini3106@gmail.com' returns 1 result in regular API but 0 results in export.

        comment: "CRITICAL BUG FIXED - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED: The issue was Supabase .in() query limitations when fetching 700+ student IDs in a single request. ROOT CAUSE: Export endpoint was trying to fetch all 712 students in ONE Supabase query using .in('id', studentIds), which caused the query to fail silently or return empty results. The regular /api/passports endpoint works because it uses pagination (20 records at a time), never hitting the query limit. FIX IMPLEMENTED: Added batching system to process students in chunks of 100 IDs per query. Changed from single Promise.all to iterative batch processing with proper error handling. Each batch fetches students and users separately, then combines results. VERIFICATION: ✅ All 712 passports now export with complete student data (names, emails, universities). ✅ Pending passports: 709 rows with full student information. ✅ Verified passports: 3 rows with full student information. ✅ CSV format and filtering working correctly. ✅ Performance: Exports 712 passports in ~4 seconds with batching. The passport export is now fully functional with all student fields properly populated."

        comment: "CRITICAL FIX FOR EXPORT FILTER ISSUE: User reported that export functions in Recruiter Management and Skill Passport pages were not working properly with filters - all data was being downloaded regardless of applied filters. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: PASSPORTS EXPORT: The endpoint was fetching ALL passports first, then applying search and university filters client-side AFTER enriching all data. This meant all data was processed but only filtered results shown in CSV. RECRUITERS EXPORT: Filter logic was mostly correct but needed improvement for 'all' values. FIX IMPLEMENTED: 1) PASSPORTS: Optimized to apply university filter at database level by first fetching student IDs from selected university, then filtering passports by those student IDs. Search filter remains client-side (requires student data) but now operates on pre-filtered dataset. 2) RECRUITERS: Enhanced filter checks to properly handle 'all' values for status, active, and state filters. Both exports now properly respect ALL applied filters and only fetch/export the filtered data matching what user sees on screen."

    message: "ORGANIZATION DATA ISSUE INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: User reported 'You are not currently linked to an organization' message in settings. ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Referential integrity issue in database. User superadmin@rareminds.in has organizationId '905b21a8-8374-4a7c-a224-46bd6f58dc4c' but this organization does NOT exist in organizations table. ✅ Session endpoint working correctly - returns organizationId but organization object is null because referenced organization doesn't exist. ✅ Database verification shows 5 available organizations (all universities) but none match user's organizationId. ❌ CRITICAL DATA ISSUE: This is causing settings page to show 'not linked to organization' message despite user having organizationId. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must either create the missing organization with ID '905b21a8-8374-4a7c-a224-46bd6f58dc4c' or update user's organizationId to reference an existing organization from the available list."

    message: "DUPLICATE RECRUITERS REMOVAL & LOGIN RESTRICTION COMPLETED: User requested two tasks: (1) Remove duplicate recruiters based on email, (2) Ensure recruiters cannot login to admin dashboard. TASK 1 COMPLETED: Created and executed Python script to identify and remove duplicate recruiters by email address. Found 15 email addresses with duplicates (28 total duplicate records). Successfully deleted all older duplicates while keeping newest record for each email. Results: 161 recruiters reduced to 133 recruiters. Major duplicates removed: hr@octsindia.com (7→1), info@panacorp.org (6→1), corporate@tafe.com (5→1). Verification confirmed database cleanup successful. TASK 2 COMPLETED: Added explicit role-based access control in login API (/api/auth/login/route.js) to reject any user with role='recruiter' with 403 Forbidden status and clear error message. Implemented belt-and-suspenders approach: (a) No recruiter user accounts exist in database (already cannot login), (b) Added explicit role check that signs out and rejects recruiters even if they somehow authenticate. This ensures recruiters can NEVER access the admin dashboard. Both tasks ready for backend testing."
